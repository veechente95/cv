  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in East Los Angeles, California more specifically a
    community called Boyle Heights. I completed my undergraduate studies at UCLA
    in 2018 majoring in Geography and minoring in Geographic Information Systems
    and Technology (GIS&T) and currently enrolled in python developer bootcamps.
    On my free time I love to cook, produce music and workout.</p>
  <h3>My Coding Experience</h3>
  <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by the world
    of tech. Coming from a career that focuses on GIS mapping, data management
    non-profit organizational work, I genuinely believed I was never good
    enough; However, I learned to accept the vulnerability and excitement to
    start again, stretch my limts and teach myself computer science.</p>
  <h3>My Goal</h3>
  <p>As a first generation Mexican-American self-taught python developer, I
    acknowledge the lack of diversity in traditional STEM fields and want to
    break the stigma by providing a diverse open door for future POC and Latinx
    folks coming from different communities, backgrounds and technical abilities.
    I want to use my story to help guide others who may have also expereinced
    similar cases of imposter syndrome.</p>
